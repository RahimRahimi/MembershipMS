<b>Overview of the Membership Management System PHP Project</b><br>
This PHP-based membership management system provides a comprehensive suite of functionalities, efficiently handling various membership types, member details, revenues, and membership card processes. The web application meticulously organizes and monitors each member, along with their membership records, ensuring a thorough overview and smooth functionality. The administrative interface offers extensive control, allowing for detailed oversight of all attributes and facilitating an intuitive and enriching user experience. Notably, the project emphasizes essential functionalities, encapsulating the key aspects of an efficient online membership management system.<br><br>
<b>Admin Panel</b><br>
The administrator has complete control over the system through a robust admin panel, which serves as the centralized control hub of this PHP membership system project. This panel empowers administrators to manage all aspects of the platform effortlessly, including memberships, revenues, membership types, and card management. It offers comprehensive control with detailed reports and insights, providing invaluable data for informed decision-making. Additionally, the integrated system settings allow administrators to easily adjust minor settings, update passwords, and change the system's currency. All features are accessible exclusively through the admin panel, ensuring that there is only one system user.<br><br>
<b>Membership Types</b><br>
An essential component of this project is the management of membership types. As previously mentioned, only the system administrator has access to the features of this membership management system. The administrator can add and manage different membership types by providing two details: the name of the membership type and its total charge or amount. Membership types can include categories such as basic, silver, bronze, premium, and others, each with their respective charges. The amount is linked to the selected membership type when adding or renewing members in the system. Additionally, the membership-type data tables facilitate quick and efficient record searches.<br><br>
<b>Membership Management</b><br>
After completing the membership type section, the administrator can add members to the system, which we refer to as the membership process. This crucial part of the project requires detailed information about each member, including their name, date of birth, address, contact information, gender, membership type, occupation, and an optional photo. If a member photo is not provided, the system will automatically attach a default photo. Upon adding new members, their status will initially be marked as expired, as they need to complete payment for their membership type through the renewal section. Additionally, new members will not receive their membership cards until payment is made.<br><br>
<b>Membership Renewal and Membership Card</b><br>
The membership renewal section is essential to this project, handling revenue and membership activation. Once a member is added, the admin must renew their record through this section. It lists all members' records with their expiry dates and status. The admin can renew each membership by selecting a type and duration, with the system automatically calculating the total amount based on these selections. Membership cards, available only to active members, include details such as membership number, name, type, photo, and validity.<br><br>

<b>Report Section and Other Features</b><br>
The admin can filter and view reports on records, including revenue and membership reports. The process for both is straightforward: the user provides a starting and ending date, and the system returns a table of records within that range. 
For membership reports, the details include membership number, name, status, and type. For revenue reports, the system displays the membership name, number, type, and amount. Both reports are printable.
Additionally, the admin can update the system's name, logo, and currency through the settings.<br><br>
